# Real time sign language detection
 This project uses computer vision and deep learning to recognize sign language gestures in real-time. It translates hand movements into letters or numbers, improving accessibility for the hearing-impaired. The system combines edge feature extraction with a CNN classifier for accurate gesture recognition.
